# Galaxy-Cluster-Analysis-Spring-2016
Currently, we are looking at neutral hydrogen gas in the intercluster medium of galaxy clusters to figure out where ram-pressure stripping is occurring. We are constructing phase-space diagrams in Python to plot where this stripping is occurring and how this relates to the shape of galaxies.
